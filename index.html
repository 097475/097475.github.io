<h1>Mattia Paccamiccio</h1>

I graduated in Computer Science in 2020 at Università di Camerino with the thesis 
<i>Visible Light Communication as Enabling Tool for Wireless Remote Control of Industrial Robots</i>
and I am presently a PhD Student at Università di Camerino, planning to graduate in 2025. 

I have also been a Guest Researcher in Middlesex University London in 2022.


My research is focused on the study and implmentation of program analysis tools based on rigorous formal methods.
The vast majority of my efforts so far have been spent on formally studying Abstract Interpretation and Symbolic Execution
and ways to apply such techniques to produce more or less approximate call graphs.


My hobbies include Weightlifting, cooking and various card games.
